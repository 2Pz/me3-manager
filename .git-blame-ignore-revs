# This file lists commits that should be ignored during git blame.
#
# Only include commits that contain purely formatting changes or file renames.
# Make sure the formatting doesn't change the behaviour of code.
# If in doubt, do not add the commit to this file.
#
# This file's name is a common convention (used by GitHub, GitLab, etc), but not
# a git default. To enable it for local git blame, configure in your repo:

#     $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
